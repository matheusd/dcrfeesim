# Decred Fee estimator simulator

This project uses the exported fees module from dcrd to perform the estimation.

Originally developed at https://github.com/matheusd/dcrfeesim_dev

## Building

This version is currently using hard-coded replacements for the module locations, so that it can be used in development.

Once the fees module is published, this will be amended to use the latest version of the fees module.
